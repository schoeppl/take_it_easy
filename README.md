Take It Easy - Solver - Genetic and Random

Fun project where I tried to find a Take It Easy - (its a fun Game) - solution. 
Found one :) 307 in less then 10 seconds!

Parameters for the search can be set directly in the binary.
Release build highly influances the performace.

ToDo:
* Usefull multi threading 
  - random search: multiple random search threads
  - genetic search: multiple threads that generate a new generation
  
* exhaustive search - find all 16? - 307 points - solutions
